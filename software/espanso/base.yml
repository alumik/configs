# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S"

  # Upgrade
  - trigger: ":up-latex"
    replace: "tlmgr update --all --self --reinstall-forcibly-removed"

  # Password
  - trigger: ":y]"
    replace: "y]A-Sr.%2&"

  # Conda environment
  - trigger: ":am"
    replace: "conda activate mcpt"
